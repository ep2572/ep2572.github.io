## Portfolio site
The site will be divided into two sections reachable from the title card and top nav bar:
 - Code - stored under `/cs/` in the directory.
 - Art & Design - stored under `/art/` in the directory.

### Code
  View samples of my code projects.
  
TODO
 - Research environments to display runnable code. Embedded container?
### Art & Design
  View my public facing artwork, which I will use for professional jobs.

TODO
 - Research a gallery view

Remember to include a hidden `skip to content` link for accessibility
